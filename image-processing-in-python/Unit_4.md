# Unit 4: Finding the edges with Canny 

1. Finding Edges
```python
# Import the canny edge detector 
from skimage.feature import canny

# Convert image to grayscale
grapefruit = color.rgb2gray(grapefruit)

# Apply canny edge detector
canny_edges = canny(grapefruit)

# Show resulting image
show_image(canny_edges, "Edges with Canny")
```
2. Less edgy 
Let's now try to spot just the outer shape of the grapefruits, the circles. You can do this by applying a more intense Gaussian filter to first make the image smoother. This can be achieved by specifying a bigger sigma in the canny function.
```python
# Apply canny edge detector with a sigma of 1.8
edges_1_8 = canny(grapefruit, sigma=1.8)

# Apply canny edge detector with a sigma of 2.2
edges_2_2 = canny(grapefruit, sigma=2.2)

# Show resulting images
show_image(edges_1_8, "Sigma of 1.8")
show_image(edges_2_2, "Sigma of 2.2")
```
